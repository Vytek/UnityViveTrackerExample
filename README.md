# UnityViveTrackerExample

Example of using two Vive trackers and controllers to control a character and record it to a generic animation (upper body only). This is a non-IK based approach and is not really suitable for player characters. It's intended to be used to record NPC animations.

**Note: This project is created in Unity 2017.1**
